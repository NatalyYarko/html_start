                <P>“I linked up with Stan McQuay in the fall of 2013. At this point I had some small successes and wins
                    in powerlifting and I placed well in a few bodybuilding shows but had yet to win one. Since linking
                    up with Stan I have had 4 class wins, 1 overall win, and brought my best physique to the USA
                    stage... Stan has been that guy in that he respects my desire to be very hands on with my prep and
                    that I will probably annoy him with wanting to know "why" we do certain things...instead of just
                    asking what to do. I couldn't be happier being part of Physique Inc and I look forward to continue
                    learning from Stan and all the other people on the coaching staff!”
